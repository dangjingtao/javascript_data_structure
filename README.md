# Javascript_data_structure

Dang Jingtao

This is my reading notes when I read Javascript Data Structures and Algorithm.

In addition, I also refer to the video tutorial of a non-famous training institution. Most of the content of the project has been rewritten. They also do not represent the best solution to the problem.

Through the study of this book, readers will be able to freely choose the most appropriate data structures and algorithms, and use them in JavaScript development. In addition, the book also outlines the JavaScript features associated with data structures and algorithms.
